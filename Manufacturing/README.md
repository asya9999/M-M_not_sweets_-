#  Manufacturing the mechanism
>Here is our report on the work undertaken

The main goal was to build detailed CAD model

## Introduction 
There are tasks, that we had to implement
1. Сделать CAD модель максимально подробную, как будто вы ее собрали (добавить винти, гайки, подшипники и все все все)
2. Заснять видео (motion study к примеру), как ваша деталь двигается
3. Сделать видео сборки вашей конструкции
4. Расшарить со мной папку со всеми материалами (share the project)
5. Залить в этот проект pdf с доп пояснениями, если требуются

Here you can find further explanations of connections between mechanism parts

## How connections are build?
We had to makeconnections, that hold the connection firmly, but part rotate freely. 

links rotate around pin, the other free and is blocked by шайба (we don't know hoe to translate it). We fasten with glue, also gap betweel pin and шайба is small (0.05mm), which also strengthens the connection

We decieded to use 1.5mm steel forelock that will hold the connection tight

It is also worth to mention that we took into account gaps between elements. To allow rotations, 0.1 gap is made

### There are problems, that we faced: 
* the tip is severely deformed, due to the reason, that bear force is applied to end of link is big. Here you can see deflection and of tool tip. There also is a video with deflection process. Also all links in mechanism are insufficiently tortified, thus, we need to strengthen them somehow

 >  How we decieded to solve it? We decieded that to make the link and tip more lasting, we need to strandthen the mechanism

  

* gears are to narrow, original width does not allow to withstand attached moments. We assumed that it is possibe to reduce deflection increacing the width of gears, but teeth deflection steel exis
